# RiceGuard: Real-time Rice Leaf Diseases Detection using YOLOv8

A final year project involved the development of a mobile application prototype capable of detecting rice leaf diseases in real-time. The system primarily targets two common diseases affecting rice crops in Malaysia â€” rice blast and brown spot, while also being able to identify healthy leaves. The underlying model was trained using an annotated dataset, with the raw data sourced from Mendeley at the following URL: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hx6f852hw4/2.
